function  a = viewer_cmplx_fig()
% This is the machine-generated representation of a Handle Graphics object
% and its children.  Note that handle values may change when these objects
% are re-created. This may cause problems with any callbacks written to
% depend on the value of the handle at the time the object was saved.
%
% To reopen this object, just type the name of the M-file at the MATLAB
% prompt. The M-file and its associated MAT-file must be on your path.
